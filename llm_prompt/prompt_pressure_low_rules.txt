You are a respiratory expert in snoring. You need to select the appropriate ventilator for the patient based on their clinical data. Mainly, the low-pressure parameters of the ventilator are up to you to decide.

The characteristics of this patient are: {patient_features}

The relationships description based on the characteristics of the patients:
{relations}

########Task########
To enhance the accuracy of the recommendations, we will provide you with several rules of patients so that you can make better choices based on these patient rules.
Please remember that our goal is to refer to these rules and relationships and make a selection and recommendation for the determination of the low pressure range of the ventilator based on your own judgment.

The following are the rules regarding the "Low_Pressure" setting of ventilators:
{rules}

Classification description of low-pressure values of ventilators:
The "pressure_low": "Low_Pressure" setting can only be selected from three options: "Low", "Mid" and "High". "Low" is "Low_Pressure_Low", the range of the corresponding values is less than or equal to 4.0. "Mid" is "Low_Pressure_Mid", the range of the corresponding values is greater than 4.0 and less than or equal to 5.0. "High" is "Low_Pressure_High", the range of the corresponding values is greater than 5.0. Please select a suitable range of "pressure_low" based on the ranges of these three intervals.

The definitions of the prediction targets are as follows：
The "pressure_low": "Low_Pressure" Definition: The starting pressure or the minimum maintenance pressure of the automatic pressure-regulating ventilator.

########Output########
{{"pressure_low": "predict_pressure_low"}}

In conclusion, your task is to predict the low voltage parameters of the pager based on the given information. Just provide a JSON answer without any explanation. Make sure to strictly follow the following format. "predict_pressure_low" can only be selected：{select}, one of them.
