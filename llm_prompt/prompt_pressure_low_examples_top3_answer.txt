You are a respiratory expert in snoring. You need to select the appropriate ventilator for the patient based on their clinical data. Mainly, the low-pressure parameters of the ventilator are up to you to decide.

The characteristics of this patient are: {patient_features}

Relevant feature descriptions:
{relations}

########Task########
To enhance the accuracy of the recommendations, we will provide you with several cases of similar patients so that you can make better choices based on these patient cases.
Please remember that our goal is to refer to these cases and relationships and make a selection and recommendation for the determination of the low pressure range of the ventilator based on your own judgment.

Please select the ventilator parameters of the following case as the answer. The patient cases related to the "low pressure" of the ventilator are as follows:
{examples}

Classification description of low-pressure values of ventilators:
The "pressure_low": "Low_Pressure" setting can only be selected from three options: "Low", "Mid" and "High". "Low" is "Low_Pressure_Low", the range of the corresponding values is less than or equal to 4.0. "Mid" is "Low_Pressure_Mid", the range of the corresponding values is greater than 4.0 and less than or equal to 5.0. "High" is "Low_Pressure_High", the range of the corresponding values is greater than 5.0. Please select a suitable range of "pressure_low" based on the ranges of these three intervals.

The definitions of the prediction targets are as follows：
The "pressure_low": "Low_Pressure" Definition: The starting pressure or the minimum maintenance pressure of the automatic pressure-regulating ventilator.

########Output########
{{"pressure_low": [answer_1, answer_2, answer_3]}}

In conclusion, return only a valid JSON object. The value for "pressure_low" must be an array of exactly three items, chosen only from ["Low_Pressure_Low", "Low_Pressure_Mid", "Low_Pressure_High"]. The three items must be distinct (no duplicates) and ordered from most to least confident (i.e., index 0 = your best choice). Do not include any explanation, comments, or extra text—JSON only.
