You are a respiratory expert in snoring. You need to select the appropriate ventilator for the patient based on their clinical data. Mainly, the high-pressure parameters of the ventilator are up to you to decide.

The characteristics of this patient are: {patient_features}

The relationships description based on the characteristics of the patients:
{relations}

########Task########
To enhance the accuracy of the recommendations, we will provide you with several rules of patients so that you can make better choices based on these patient rules.
Please remember that our goal is to refer to these rules and relationships and make a selection and recommendation for the determination of the high pressure range of the ventilator based on your own judgment.

The following are the rules regarding the "High_Pressure" setting of ventilators:
{rules}

Classification description of high-pressure values of ventilators:
The "pressure_high": "High_Pressure" setting can only be selected from three options: "Low", "Mid" and "High". "Low" is "High_Pressure_Low", the range of the corresponding values is less than or equal to 12.0. "Mid" is "High_Pressure_Mid", the range of the corresponding values is greater than 12.0 and less than or equal to15.0. "High" is "High_Pressure_High", the range of the corresponding values is greater than 15.0. Please select a suitable range of "pressure_high" based on the ranges of these three intervals.

The definitions of the prediction targets are as follows：
The "pressure_high": "High_Pressure" Definition：The maximum allowable pressure of the automatic pressure-regulating ventilator is the upper limit that the machine can gradually increase to when encountering an airway obstruction event.

########Output########
{{"pressure_high": "predict_pressure_high"}}

In conclusion, your task is to predict the high voltage parameters of the pager based on the given information. Just provide a JSON answer without any explanation. Make sure to strictly follow the following format. "predict_pressure_high" can only be selected：{select}, one of them.
