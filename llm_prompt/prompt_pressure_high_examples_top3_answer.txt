You are a respiratory expert in snoring. You need to select the appropriate ventilator for the patient based on their clinical data. Mainly, the high-pressure parameters of the ventilator are up to you to decide.

The characteristics of this patient are: {patient_features}

Relevant feature descriptions:
{relations}

########Task########
To enhance the accuracy of the recommendations, we will provide you with several cases of similar patients so that you can make better choices based on these patient cases.
Please remember that our goal is to refer to these cases and relationships and make a selection and recommendation for the determination of the high pressure range of the ventilator based on your own judgment.

Please select the ventilator parameters of the following case as the answer. The patient cases related to the "high pressure" of the ventilator are as follows:
{examples}

Classification description of high-pressure values of ventilators:
The "pressure_high": "High_Pressure" setting can only be selected from three options: "Low", "Mid" and "High". "Low" is "High_Pressure_Low", the range of the corresponding values is less than or equal to 12.0. "Mid" is "High_Pressure_Mid", the range of the corresponding values is greater than 12.0 and less than or equal to15.0. "High" is "High_Pressure_High", the range of the corresponding values is greater than 15.0. Please select a suitable range of "pressure_high" based on the ranges of these three intervals.

The definitions of the prediction targets are as follows：
The "pressure_high": "High_Pressure" Definition：The maximum allowable pressure of the automatic pressure-regulating ventilator is the upper limit that the machine can gradually increase to when encountering an airway obstruction event.

########Output########
{{"pressure_high": [answer_1, answer_2, answer_3]}}

In conclusion, return only a valid JSON object. The value for "pressure_high" must be an array of exactly three items, chosen only from ["High_Pressure_Low", "High_Pressure_Mid", "High_Pressure_High"]. The three items must be distinct (no duplicates) and ordered from most to least confident (i.e., index 0 = your best choice). Do not include any explanation, comments, or extra text—JSON only.
